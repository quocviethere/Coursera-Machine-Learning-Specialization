It implies that it is able to learn the patterns from your training set without overfitting. If you used the defaults in this lab, you will notice a sharp drop in cross validation error from the models with degree=1 to degree=2. This is followed by a relatively flat line up to degree=5. After that, however, the cross validation error is generally getting worse as you add more polynomial features. Given these, you can decide to use the model with the lowest `cv_mse` as the one best suited for your application."
